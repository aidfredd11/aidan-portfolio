                    <p>
                       More specifically deep artificial neural networks, and their use for solving 
                       vastly complex problems is of great interest to me.
                       In a recent academic project, I used the Python framework PyTorch
                       and its built-in AlexNet pretained model to extract features from a dataset of 
                       50,000 training images.

                        This site was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript,
                        however, I have used both Angular and React for web development. Past projects of mine
                        include using the MEAN stack to develop a library checkout system, and using the 
                        MERN stack to develop an ecommerce application, complete with user authentication.

                        The feeling of seeing a virtual world that you have created in action, is one like no other. 
                        Using Unity and C#, I have programmed both games and developer tools. Three notable projects of
                        mine are a maze running game, a rock-climbing game, and a custom Unity editor tool for character
                        customization.

                    I was born and raised in St. Thomas, Ontario, and began my studies at nearby Western University in the fall of 2017.
                    In the spring of 2022, I recieved my Bachelor of Engineering Science in Software Engineering after 5 years of hard work.
                    I was a member of the student groups Get Real Western, the Western Climbing Club, and Phi Delta Theta Fraternity
                    throughout my time at university. Technology has always been one of my biggest interests,
                    and I am eager to continue developing my skills in order to solve complex challenges.
